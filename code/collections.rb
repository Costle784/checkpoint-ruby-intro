# collections

# 1. In a variable `point1` create a hash representing a coordinate with an `x` and `y` integer values

# 2. Print the y value

# 3. Make an array that includes `point1` and two more points and assign to a variable `points` (`points.length` should be 3)

# 4. Use `.each` to print the y value of each point

# 5. Use `.each_with_index` and string interpolation to print for each point "The point at index <index> has coordinates {x: <x-val>, y: <y-val>}"

# 6. Create an array and call it `distances_from_origin` by mapping over the points and returning the distance between the point and origin, (0,0).
# Distance from origin can be found by the equation `distance_from_origin = Math.sqrt(x_val ** 2 + y_val ** 2)`
